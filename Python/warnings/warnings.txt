warnings.warn to issue a warning and not ignore the line

Python installs several warning filters, which can be overridden by the command-line options passed to -W and calls to filterwarnings().

DeprecationWarning and PendingDeprecationWarning, and ImportWarning are ignored.
BytesWarning is ignored unless the -b option is given once or twice; in this case this warning is either printed (-b) or turned into an exception (-bb).

By default, DeprecationWarning is ignored. You can change the filters using the following:

warnings.simplefilter('always', DeprecationWarning)

Now your warnings should be printed:

>>> import warnings
>>> warnings.simplefilter('always', DeprecationWarning)
>>> warnings.warn('test', DeprecationWarning)
