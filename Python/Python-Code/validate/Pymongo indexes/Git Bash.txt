Welcome to the HW 4.3 Checker. My job is to make sure you added the indexes
that make the blog fast in the following three situations
        When showing the home page
        When fetching a particular post
        When showing all posts for a particular tag
Data looks like it is properly loaded into the posts collection
Home page is super fast. Nice job.
Blog retrieval by permalink is super fast. Nice job.
Blog retrieval by tag is super fast. Nice job.
Tests Passed for HW 4.3. Your HW 4.3 validation code is 893jfns29f728fn29f20f2
