# Customize look and feel
# Django will look for static files there, similarly to how Django finds templates inside polls/templates/
# Django's STATICFILES_FINDERS setting contains a list of finders that know how to discover static files from various sources
# One of the defaults is AppDirectoriesFinder which looks for a "static" subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS
# The admin site uses the same directory structure for its static files
# Because of how the AppDirectoriesFinder, static file can be referred to in Django as polls/style.css, similar to how you reference the path for templates
# Django will choose the first static file it finds whose name matches
# If there was a static file with the same name in a different application, Django would be unable to distinguish between them

# Note
# {% static %} template tag is not available for use in static files like your stylesheet which aren't generated by Django
# You should always use relative paths to link your static files between each other
# Because then you can change STATIC_URL (used by the static template tag to generate its URLs) without having to modify a bunch of paths in static files as well
