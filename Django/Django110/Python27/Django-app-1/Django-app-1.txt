# The development server
$ python manage.py runserver


# [Changing the port
By default, the runserver command starts the development server on the internal IP at port 8000.
If you want to change the server’s port, pass it as a command-line argument. For instance, this command starts the server on port 8080:
python manage.py runserver 8080

If you want to change the server's IP, pass it along with the port. So to listen on all public IPs (useful if you want to show off your work on other computers on your network), use:
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# Note
Ignore the warning about unapplied database migrations for now; we’ll deal with the database shortly.

# Projects vs. apps
What's the difference between a project and an app? An app is a Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a simple poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.
